# Server-Hosting plattform.
This is the internal Server-Hosting plattform. It serves as the primary backend and is deployed on the mainframe. It uses [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) as the fullstack framework enviroment and [Supabase](https://supabase.com) as the database and authentication backend.
It is used to manage the wings, payment and UI/UX for OreCrunch. 

## Getting Started

Run the development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

**_NOTE:_** You have to start the supabase backend for full functionality. You can do this by running the docker compose.
